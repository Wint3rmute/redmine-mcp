- **redmine://issues/recent** - Recently updated issues
- **redmine://time_entries/recent** - Recently logged time entries

### Prompts

- **issue_summary** - Generate comprehensive project issue summaries
- **time_report** - Create detailed time tracking reports

## Usage with MCP Clients

### VsCode

Clone this repository and create the file `.vscode/mcp.json` with following
contents:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "redmine-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "REDMINE_URL": "your URL here",
        "REDMINE_API_KEY": "your API key here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated from JSDoc comments and deployed to
GitHub Pages:

ðŸ“š **[View API Documentation](https://wint3rmute.github.io/redmine-mcp/)**

To generate documentation locally:

```bash
npm run docs
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs/` directory.

## Development

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

### E2E Testing

The project includes automated end-to-end tests that run against a Dockerized
Redmine instance:

```bash
npm test
```

For detailed instructions on running e2e tests locally, see
[test/README.md](test/README.md).

The e2e tests:

- Use Node.js built-in test runner (`node:test`)
- Run Redmine in Docker with SQLite (no external database needed)
- Pre-seed the database with a test user and API token
- Verify API token authentication and basic API functionality
